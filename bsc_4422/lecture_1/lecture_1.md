## Types of Biotechnology

-   **Microbial Biotechnology**

    -   Use of microorganisms to make valuable products and applications
        -   Ex. scientists manipulate bacteria and yeast to:
            -   Create better enzymes
            -   Simplify manufacturing and production processes
            -   Make vaccines and batch amount of proteins for human medicine
            -   Make more efficient decontamination processes for industrial waste removal
    -   Use genetically modified cultured cells to make protein of interest.

-   **Agricultural Biotechnology**

    -   Genetically engineer plants to make valuable products
        -   Ex. scientists genetically engineer plants to:
            -   Be more environmentally friendly and yield more per acre (genetically engineered)
            -   Resistance to diseases and insects
            -   Foods with higher protein or vitamin content
            -   Drugs developed and grown as plant products
            -   Drought-resistant and tolerant to cold temperatures
    -   These better plants ultimately reduce production costs to help feed the growing world population.
    -   United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization predicts by 2050, we will need to feed a world population of 9.1 billion! This requires raising food production by approximately 70%!

-   **Animal Biotechnology**

    -   Genetically engineer animals to make valuable products

        -   Ex. scientists genetically engineer animals to be:

            -   used as "bioreactors" for producing medically valuable proteins
                -   Ex. antibodies and therapeutic proteins
                -   **There are strong opinions on both sides for the use of transgenic animals**
                    -   **Transgenic Animal**: Way to achieve large scale production of therapeutic proteins from animals for use in humans
                    -   Female transgenic animals express therapeutic proteins in milk (contains genes from another source)
                    -   Ex. Human genes coding for anti-clotting proteins can be introduced into female goats for production of these proteins in their milk
                        -   ATryn (Antithrombin)
            -   used as model organisms
                -   Ex. "knockout" gene experiments
                -   **Gene Knockout**:
                    -   Disrupt a gene in the animal and then look at what functions are affected in the animal as a result of the loss of the gene.
                    -   This allows researchers to determine the role and function of the gene.
                    -   Since humans are similar to rats and mice, gene knockout studies in rats and mice can lead to better understanding of gene function in humans.
            -   organismal cloning
                -   Ex. genetically engineered organs w/o tissue rejection
