# Aggregate Functions

## Introduction

Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called aggregates.

Here is a preview of some important aggregates:

-   `COUNT()`: count the number of rows
-   `SUM()`: the sum of the values in a column
-   `MAX()`: the largest value
-   `MIN()` the smallest value
-   `AVG()`: the average of the values in a column
-   `ROUND()`: round the values in the column

For simplicity, assume we are using a database of fake apps.

## Count

The fastest way to calculate how many rows are in a table is to use the `COUNT()` function.

`COUNT()` is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;
```

Here, we want to count every row, so we pass `*` as an argument inside the parenthesis.

## Sum

SQL makes it easy to add all values in a particular column using `SUM()`.

`SUM()` is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.

```sql
SELECT SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

This adds all the values in the `downloads` column.

## Max / Min

The `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions return the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.

How many downloads does the most popular app have? 

```sql
SELECT MAX(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

`MAX()` takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the largest value in that column. Here, we returned the largest value in the `downloads` column.

`MIN()` works the same way but it does the exact opposite; it returns the smallest value.

## Average

SQL uses the `AVG()` function to quickly calculate the average value of a particular column.

The statement below returns the average number of downloads for an app in the database:

```sql
SELECT AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

The `AVG()` function works by taking a column name as an argument and returns the average value for that column.

## Round

By default, SQL tries to be as precise as possible without rounding. We can make the result table easier to read using the `ROUND()` function. 

The `ROUND()` function takes two arguments inside the parenthesis:

1.  A column name
2.  An integer

It rounds the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer.

```sql
SELECT ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;
```

Here, we pass the column `price` and integer `0` as arguments. SQL rounds the values in the column to 0 decimal places in the output.

## Group By

Oftentimes, you will want to calculate an aggregate for data with certain characteristics.

For instance, you might want to know the mean IMDb ratings for all movies each year. We could calculate each number by a series of queries with different `WHERE` statements, like so:

```sql
SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 1999;

SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 2000;

...
```

and so on.

Instead, we can use `GROUP BY` to do this in a single step:

```sql
SELECT year,
	AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
GROUP by year
ORDER BY year;
```

`GROUP BY` is a clause in SQL that is used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the `SELECT` statement to arrange identical data into *groups*.

The `GROUP BY` statement comes after any `WHERE` statements, but before `ORDER BY` or `LIMIT`.

Sometimes, we want to `GROUP BY` a calculation done on a column. For instance, we might want to know how many movies have IMDb ratings that round to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. We could do this using the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
	COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY ROUND(imdb_rating)
ORDER BY ROUND(imdb_rating);
```

However, this query may be time-consuming to write and more prone to error. 

SQL lets us use column reference(s) in our `GROUP BY` that will make our lives easier.

-   `1` is the first column selected.
-   `2` is the second column selected.
-   `3` is the third column selected.

and so on.

The following query equivalent to the one above:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
	COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;	
```

Here, the `1` refers to the first column in our `SELECT` statement, `ROUND(imdb_rating)`.

## Having

In addition to being able to group data by using `GROUP BY`, SQL also allows you to filter which groups to include and which to exclude.

For instance, imagine that we want to see how many movies of different genres were produced each year, but we only care about years and genres with at least 10 movies.

We can't use `WHERE` here because we don't want to filter the rows; we want to *filter* groups. This is where `HAVING` comes in.

`HAVING` is very similar to `WHERE`. In fact, all types of `WHERE` clauses can be used with `HAVING`.

```sql
SELECT year,
	genre
	COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(name) > 10;
```

-   When we want to limit the results of a query based on values of the individual rows, use `WHERE`.
-   When we want to limit the results of a query based on a aggregate property, use `HAVING`.

The `HAVING`Â  statement always comes after `GROUP BY`, but before `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.
